		<h3>Poincar&eacute Recurrence Theorem</h3>
		<p><b>Theorem (Poincar&eacute Recurrence, strong form)</b>.<i> If \((X, \mathscr{B}, \mu)\) is a finite measure space and T preserves \(\mu\), then for any \(B \in \mathscr{B}\) with positive measure \(\mu(B) > 0\), \(\mu\)-almost every point \(x \in B\) is infinitely recurrent to \(B\)</i>.</p>
		<p><i>Proof</i>. Let \(A\) be the set of points in \(B\) that do not return to \(B\) infinitely many times. That is, \(A =\) {\(x \in B\) such that there exists \(k \geq 1\) such that \(T^n(x) \in B\) for all \(n \geq k\)}. Consider the set \(A_0 =\) {\(x \in B\) such that \(T^n(x) \not\in B\) for all \(n>0\)} and the sets \(A_k = T^{-k}(A_0)\) for \(k \geq 1\). If \(x \in T^{-k}(A_0)\) then \(T^k(x) \in A_0\), so \(T^k(x) \in B\) and \(T^n(T^k(x)) = T^{k+n}(x) \not\in B\) for all \(n > 0\). Thus, \(A_k =\) {\(x\) such that \(T^k(x) \in B\) and \(T^n(x) \not\in B\) for all \(n>k\)}.</p>
		<p>One can then write $$A = B \cap \bigcup_{k=0}^{+\infty}A_k$$Indeed, if \(x \in A\), let \(k\) be the largest integer such that \(T^k(x) \in B\), which is well-defined since there are only finitely many such integers by the definition of A; then \(x \in A_k\). Conversely, if \(x \in B \cap A_k\), then for some \(k\), \(T^k(x) \in B\) for all \(n > k\), so \(x\) can return only finitely many times and belongs to \(A\). By the monotonicity of a measure, $$A \subset \bigcup_{k=0}^{+\infty}A_k \implies \mu(A) \leq \mu(\bigcup_{k=0}^{+\infty}A_k)$$</p>
		<p><b>Lemma</b>. {\(A_k\)}\(_{k \in \mathbb{N}}\) <i>are pairwise disjoint.</i></p>
		<p><i>Proof</i>. Suppose not. Then there would exist \(i, j\) with \(i \neq j\) such that $$A_i \cap A_j \neq \emptyset \iff \exists x \in A_i \cup A_j$$Then there would exist \(i\) such that \(T^i(x) \in B\) and \(T^n(x) \not\in B\) for \(n>i\), and \(j\) such that \(T^j(x) \in B\) and \(T^m(x) \not\in B\) for \(m>j\). Without loss of generality, suppose \(i < j\). Then \(T^i(x) \in B\) and \(T^j(x) \in B\), contradicting the definition of \(A_i\). Therefore, {\(A_k\)}\(_{k \in \mathbb{N}}\) are pairwise disjoint.</p>
		<p>Then, by the definition of a measure and the finiteness of \(\mu\),$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\mu(A_k) = \mu\left(\bigcup_{k=0}^{+\infty}A_k\right) \leq \mu(X) < +\infty$$ Furthermore, \(\mu(A_k) = \mu(A_0)\) for all \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) since \(A_k = T^{-k}(A_0)\) and \(T\) is measure-preserving. The only possibility to have a convergent series with non-negative terms is \(\mu(A_0) = \mu(A_k) = 0\) for all \(k \in \mathbb{N}\). Then, $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\mu(A_k) = 0 \implies \mu(A) \leq \mu\left(\bigcup_{k=0}^{+\infty}A_k\right) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\mu(A_k) = 0$$ Thus, \(\mu(A) = 0\), and almost every point in \(B\) is infinitely recurrent.</p>
